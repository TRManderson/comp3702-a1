\section{Agent}
What is the formal definition of the navigation agent in this assignment? What type of agent is the navigation agent (i.e., discrete/continuous, fully/partially observable, deterministic/non-deterimistic, static/dynamic)? Please explain your selection.


\section{Heuristic Selection}
What is the heuristic you use for A* search? Please explain why do you think it is a good heuristic?


\section{Uniform Search/A* comparison}
Please compare the performance (in terms of time and space) of Uniform Cost and A* search as the number of vertices in the graph increases. Please explain your findings. This explanation should include comparisons with the theoretical results


\section{Question 5}
Suppose you article given 2 environment maps, say A and B. True or False that if the number of vertices in A is larger than in B, then given the same implementation of A* search, finding an optimal path in A will always take longer time than in B? Please explain your answer.
